Can we forget about the things I said
When I was drunk?
I didn't mean to call you that
I can't remember what was said
Or what you threw at me
Please tell me, please tell me why?
My car is in the front yard
And I'm sleepin' with my clothes on
I came in through the window last night
And you're gone, gone
It's no surprise to me
I am my own worst enemy
'Cause every now and then
I kick the livin' shit out of me
The smoke alarm is going off
When there's a cigarette
Still burnin'
Please tell me why?
My car is in the front yard
And I'm sleepin' with my clothes on
I came in through the window last night
And you're gone, gone
Please tell me why?
My car is in the front yard
And I'm sleepin' with my clothes on
I came in through the window last night
It's no surprise to me
I am my own worst enemy
'Cause every now and then
I kick the livin' shit out of me
Can we forget about the things I said
When I was drunk
I didn't mean to call you that
