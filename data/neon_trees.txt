Here we go again
I kinda wanna be more than friends
So take it easy on me
I'm afraid you're never satisfied
Here we go again
We're sick like animals
We play pretend
You're just a cannibal
And I'm afraid I won't get out alive
No, I won't sleep tonight
Oh, oh
I want some more
Oh, oh
What are you waitin' for?
Take a bite of my heart tonight
Oh, oh
I want some more
Oh, oh
What are you waitin' for?
What are you waitin' for?
Say goodbye to my heart tonight
Here we are again
I feel the chemicals kickin' in
It's gettin' heavier
I wanna run and hide
I wanna run and hide
I do it every time
You're killin' me now
And I won't be denied by you
The animal inside of you
Oh, oh
I want some more
Oh, oh
What are you waitin' for?
Take a bite of my heart tonight
Oh, oh
I want some more
Oh, oh
What are you waitin' for?
What are you waitin' for?
Say goodbye to my heart tonight
Hush, hush, the world is quiet
Hush, hush we both can't fight it
It's us that made this mess
Why can't you understand?
Whoa, I won't sleep tonight
I won't sleep tonight
Here we go again
Oh, oh
I want some more
Oh, oh
What are you waitin' for?
Take a bite of my heart tonight
Oh, oh
I want some more
Oh, oh
What are you waitin' for?
What are you waitin' for?
What are you waitin'
Take a bite of my heart tonight
Oh, oh
I want some more
Oh, oh
What are you waitin' for?
What are you waitin' for?
Say goodbye to my heart tonight
