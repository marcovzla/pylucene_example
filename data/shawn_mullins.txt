From all that is in me,
I say these words with freedom on my tongue
I give to you all of me, 
In this crazy world, life has just begun
No one can take that away, 
It just keeps pourin' out like juice from berries on the vine
Nowhere is where I will be, 
Without you and me, valentine
Don't mind my preciousness, 
I sing these words cause that's the way I feel
Men, men have killed for less, 
I'd do the same if harm was ever hurled your way
I, I'll try to explain, 
It just keeps pourin' out like juice from berries on the vine
Nowhere is where I will be, 
Without you and me, valentine
And when the storms roll in, and nothin's goin' right
I'll be the one who holds you (oh yeah), rock you through the night
No one can take that away, 
It just keeps pourin' out like juice from berries on the vine
Nowhere is where I will be, 
Without you and me, hey valentine
No one can take that away, 
It just keeps pourin' out like juice, like juice from berries on the vine
Nowhere is where I will be, 
Without you and me, valentine
